# Android-Application-for-Visually-Impaired

It is a realtime object recognition and classification system for visually impaired, which can be leveraged as an outdoor navigation system with voice commands. In this model, I used K-Nearest Neighbor to classify the images using ILSVRC 2015 dataset which has 1000 object categories containing internal and leaf nodes of ImageNet. Currently, I am modifying it to use Deep Convolutional Nueral Networks so as to improve performance in some domains.

Abstract— Image Recognition and the image classification has been one of the weighing gravitate towards computer vision and has been lagging in certainty. The field of Machine Learning has made a tremendous progress in object detection with a refined quality. With the usage of model like SVM, KNN, Bag of words we have improved our classification precision but still sparring with the amount of accuracy until deep convolutional neural networks came in existence with which we can exceed human performance in some domains. Here in this paper we introduced Tensorflow based model which uses deep convolutional network of 22 layers deep network which is trained with dataset of ILSVRC 2014 with a thousand classes to classify the image. We built an android application that can dynamically recognize and classify the images on the screen with an intuition of multi-scale processing.
